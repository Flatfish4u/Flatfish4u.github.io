# The Temporal Differences in Chess Between ADHD and Neurotypical Individuals

## Overview
This research investigates temporal differences in chess gameplay between ADHD and neurotypical players, analyzing over 9,800 games across various skill levels and time controls. The study reveals distinct patterns in time management and decision-making, with significant variations observed across different game phases and complexity levels.

## Dataset
- 9,810 chess games analyzed (2,150 ADHD, 7,660 control)
- 354,385 individual moves analyzed
- Multiple ELO brackets and time controls

## Key Findings

### Time Management Patterns
- ADHD players showed distinct temporal patterns across different time controls
- In Blitz games (1000-1400 ELO), ADHD players progressively increased time usage from +4.56s to +19.12s over 40 moves
- In Rapid games, pattern reversed with ADHD players consistently faster

### Decision Making Under Pressure
- Both groups showed increased error rates under time pressure
- ADHD players demonstrated unique adaptation strategies
- Time control format significantly modulated ADHD effects

## Research Paper
The complete research paper examines these findings in detail, including:
- Comprehensive methodology
- Detailed statistical analysis
- Implications for understanding ADHD cognitive processing
- Future research directions

## Implications
This research provides valuable insights into how ADHD affects decision-making in complex, time-sensitive situations. The findings have potential applications in:
- Understanding cognitive processing differences
- Developing targeted interventions
- Improving time management strategies

## Future Directions
- Eye-tracking studies to examine attention patterns
- Neuroimaging investigation of cognitive processes
- Controlled studies with verified ADHD diagnoses
