My name is **Benjamin Rosales**. I'm a neuroscience graduate from [UCSC](https://www.ucsc.edu) who's in the process of applying to Medical School. I am pursuing a career in medicine because there are too few doctors who speak my people's language and understand my peoples culture. It is my goal to bring high-quality medical care to my home of Southern Los Angeles
